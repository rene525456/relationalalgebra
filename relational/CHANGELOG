1.0
- Adds history in the GUI
- Adds menus to the GUI
- Checks if given name to relations are valid
- Discards the old and not so functional tlb format
- Float type recognition is more robust, now handled using a regexp

- Tuples are internally mapped on tuples and no longer on lists
- Set hash method for the classes
- Parsing of strings representing dates is now cached, eliminating the need for double parse
- Fixed python expression tokenization, now uses native tokenizer
- Fixed optimization involving selection and parenthesis in the expression (Rev 260)
- Fixed futile_union_intersection_subtraction optimization that didn't work when selection operator was in the left subtree (Rev 261)

0.11
- Font is set only on windows (Rev 206)

- Can load relations specified in command line (Rev 210)
- Using fakeroot instead of su in make debian (Rev 214)
- Fixed problem with float numbers with selection of certain relations (Rev 215)

- Does not depend on QT anymore
- Added readline user interface
- Added division operator

0.10
- In optimizer, added a function that tokenizes an expression
- Document about complexity of operations
- Bug: error in update operation, it changed the original tuple, so also other relations using the same tuple would change. Now it copies it.
- Added make install and uninstall
- Optimizer generate a tree from the expression
- Uses python-psyco when it is available
- Ability to perform optimizations from GUI
- Able to (temporarily) store queries with a name
- Mechanism to add new kind of optimizations, without having to edit all the code
- Implemented duplicated_select general optimization
- Implemented down_to_unions_subtractions_intersections general optimization
- Implemented duplicated_projection general optimization
- Implemented selection_inside_projection general optimization
- Implemented subsequent_renames general optimization
- Implemented swap_rename_select general optimization
- Implemented selection_and_product specific optimization
- Added stub for converting SQL to relational algebra
- Implemented futile_union_intersection_subtraction general optimization
- Implemented swap_rename_projection general optimization
- Replaced old relational algebra to python compiler with new one based on the new tokenizer/parser (Rev 188)
- Code refactory to move the new parser into parser.py out of optimizer.py, that will still be compatible (Rev 190)
- Selection can now accept expressions with parenthesis

0.9
- Splitted into independent packages (gui and library)
- Simplified makefile, bringing outside files for debian package
- Default source package now doesn't contain informations to generate debian/mac packages
- "make source_all" generates the old style tarball containing all the files
- Bug: relational script installed with debian package now passes arguments to the python executable
- Insert and delete from GUI are now done on the displayed relation, not on the selected one

0.8
- Added __eq__ to relation object, will compare ignoring order.
- New default relation's format is csv, as defined in RFC4180
- Converted sample's relations to csv
- Deb postinstall generates optimized files, this will increase loading speed
- Relation module has SQL-like delete
- Relation module has SQL-like update
- Relation module has SQL-like insert
- GUI can be used to insert and delete tuples
- Showing fields of selected relation will work with themes different than oxygen

0.7
- Added README
- Expressions between quotes aren't parsed anymore
- When adding a relation, the file must be chosen 1st, and then the default relation's name is the same as the filename
- Changed internal rename method. Now uses a dictionary
- Optimized saving of relations
- Can save relations from gui
- Outer join methods simplified
- Form to send a survey
- Makefile to create .deb package

0.6
- Fixes to run on Mac OsX
- Added Makefile
- Able to create .app MacOsX files using "make app"
- Able to create tar.gz file containing Mac OsX application and samples using "make mac"
